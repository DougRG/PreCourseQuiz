## Making a Class

Create a new Class called Car. Give Car the following properties: make: String, model: String, year: Int, topSpeed: Int, and isStreetLegal: Bool optional.

Make an init method and initalize your class.

Print all of the properties. Unwrap the isStreetLegal optional. If it is street legal: print "Good to go". If it is not street legal: print "Pull over". If it is nil: print "Haven't checked"
